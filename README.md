Overview:
This website uses a form to login into the site. The form takes a name and password; the password requires at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, one special character, and it has to be eight characters long (this is to test the regex). The site itself contains a page with text, an image, a table, and an animation. A third page contains calculator that can preform basic mathematic functions. These pages can be navigated with a dropdown menu. The dropdown menu is actually a seperate html file inserted to the other pages by an <iframe> tag.
